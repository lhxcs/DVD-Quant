> **Abstract:** Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art architecture for video generation, yet their computational and memory demands hinder practical deployment. While post-training quantization (PTQ) presents a promising approach to accelerate Video DiT models, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) dependence on lengthy, computation-heavy calibration procedures, and (2) considerable performance deterioration after quantization. To address these challenges, we propose $\mathcal{DVD}$-Quant, a novel Data-free quantization framework for Video DiTs. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) **Progressive Bounded Quantization (PBQ)** and (2) **Auto-scaling Rotated Quantization(ARQ)** for calibration data-free quantization error reduction, as well as (3) **$\delta$-Guided Bit Switching ($\delta$-GBS)** for adaptive bit-width allocation. Extensive experiments across multiple video generation benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathcal{DVD}$-Quant achieves an approximately $2\times$ speedup over full-precision baselines on HunyuanVideo while maintaining visual fidelity. Notably, $\mathcal{DVD}$-Quant is the first to enable W4A4 PTQ for Video DiTs without compromising video quality.
